      content2: "Web2 is the internet as we know it today. It’s built around big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon that control most of the websites and apps we use. Let me summerise it in bullet points", 
      point1: "Centralized Control- – Companies own and store all the data (your Instagram posts, messages, purchases, etc).",
      point2: "You are the product- – Social media, search engines, and websites collect your data to show ads or sell it to companies.",
      point3: "Middlemen for transactions – Payments online go through banks or services like PayPal, which take a fee.",
      point4: "Login with an account- – You log into apps using an email, username, or social media account.",
      subTitle3: "What is Web3?",
      content3: "Web3 is a decentralized version of the internet. Instead of companies controlling everything, it runs on blockchain technology, giving users more control over their data and transactions.",
      point5: "Decentralized Control** – Instead of companies storing data, it’s distributed across a blockchain network.",
      point6: "You own your data** – No one can track or sell your personal information without your permission.",
      point7: "No middlemen** – Payments happen using cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) without banks taking a cut.",
      point8: "Login with wallets** – Instead of using usernames and passwords, Web3 apps let you log in using a crypto wallet, which acts as your digital identity.",
