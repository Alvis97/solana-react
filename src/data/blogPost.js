      content: `
        In order to understand how Crypto and Blockchain work, we need to dig into the foundation: Web2 and Web3.
  
        **Web2** is the internet as we know it today. It’s built around big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon that control most of the websites and apps we use. 
  
        ### How Web2 Works:
        1. **Centralized Control** – Companies own and store all the data (your Instagram posts, messages, purchases, etc).
        2. **You are the product** – Social media, search engines, and websites collect your data to show ads or sell it to companies.
        3. **Middlemen for transactions** – Payments online go through banks or services like PayPal, which take a fee.
        4. **Login with an account** – You log into apps using an email, username, or social media account.
  
        **What is Web3?**
        Web3 is a decentralized version of the internet. Instead of companies controlling everything, it runs on blockchain technology, giving users more control over their data and transactions.
  
        ### How Web3 Works:
        1. **Decentralized Control** – Instead of companies storing data, it’s distributed across a blockchain network.
        2. **You own your data** – No one can track or sell your personal information without your permission.
        3. **No middlemen** – Payments happen using cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) without banks taking a cut.
        4. **Login with wallets** – Instead of using usernames and passwords, Web3 apps let you log in using a crypto wallet, which acts as your digital identity.
